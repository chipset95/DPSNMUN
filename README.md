# DPSNMUN'14

**Commitment Redifined**

It is with great pride that the Delhi Public School Noida Model United Nations Club presents to you the inaugural edition of DPSNMUN'14.
After a lot of dedicated work, we bring to you 4 sublime committees to provide a platform for substantive debate and deliberation on global issues that are rarely brought to light at school-level MUNs.
For more information, stay tuned to our official app.

Regards
Secretariat
